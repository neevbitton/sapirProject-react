# AnomaVision React Project

This project is part of my final year work.  
It contains a React + Vite frontend connected to a Python Flask backend for anomaly detection.  

## Installation
```bash
npm install

### 1. Start the Server
First, navigate to the server folder and run the backend:

```bash
cd server
node index.js


### 1. Start the Client
npm run dev
